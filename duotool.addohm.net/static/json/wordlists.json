The same thing also happens with words like “this” or “that” (demonstrative pronouns).</p>\n<p>We do something similar in English, but to a much lesser degree. A few examples are “a plate of spaghetti,” “a bowl of rice,” “a bottle of water,” “a pack of dogs,” etc. In Chinese, you need to use a measure word whenever you use 这 (this), 那 (that), or a number. The most common word used is 个, which is used for people and objects in general.

      "explanation": "<h4><strong>了</strong></h4>\n<p>In Chinese, 了 le (neutral tone)  is a commonly seen character with many uses. Here, 了 is used to show the completion of an action. To make a verb or a verb phrase indicate completeness, you just need to add 了 after it. So you can finally express past tense actions! Keep in mind, however, that you can also see this in sentences about the future when 了 is showing that one action was completed before another.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Chinese</th>\n<th>Pinyin</th>\n<th>English</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>你吃了吗？</td>\n<td>Nǐ chī le ma?</td>\n<td>Did you eat?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>我买了一个苹果。</td>\n<td>Wǒ[wó] mǎi le yī[yí] gè píngguǒ.</td>\n<td>I bought an apple.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>他做了作业。</td>\n<td>Tā zuò le zuòyè.</td>\n<td>He did homework.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>我到了告诉你。</td>\n<td>Wǒ dào le gàosù nǐ.</td>\n<td>When I arrive, I will tell you. / I will tell you when I arrive.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4><strong>会</strong></h4>\n<p>会 huì can be used to indicate future tense. Simply place it before the verb or adjective and it will place the context of the sentence into the future.

      "explanation": "<p>Chinese sentences and English sentences have a very similar word order. For both, you generally have the subject (who is performing the action), followed by the verb (what that person or thing is doing), and lastly the object (what is receiving the action).</p>\n<p>To negate a sentence, you simply add the word 不 bù (no) before the verb.

The verb 'to eat', 吃 chī, is one of these. In order to say \"I eat\" or \"I am eating\" in Chinese, you have to include what is being eaten, you cannot use 吃 just by itself.</p>\n<p>The most common object people will use for the verb 'to eat' is rice, 饭 fàn, since in China it is eaten with almost every meal.</p>\n<p><strong>面</strong></p>\n<p>The word \"noodles\" is also in this skill. Chinese nouns don't show singular or plural in the same way that English words do. To specify if a word is plural or not, you have to use a number or another word (some, a few, etc.). The sentence 你吃面 nǐ chī miàn will translate as \"You eat noodles\" because it would be a bit odd to just eat a single noodle.</p>"
